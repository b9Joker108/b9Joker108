- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @b9Joker108
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in Sanskrit, Tibetan, Dharmic Traditions, Bash, Zsh, Semiotics, Linguistics, Runes and Heathenism, amongst other things. I am fascinated by hacker culture. üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Bash and Zsh in relation to each other on my Android devices. To productively aid in this, I am building an Intranet with Notion, which is my new favorite Android app. In truth, as a learning tool, it is a revelation and I endorse it. I am circa 50 years old, and am of the first generation of children that taught themselves computers and computing. That is both a boon and a bane. My first computer was a Commodore 64 and my first programming experience was with Commodore BASIC, which didn't exactly whet my appetite for Computer Science. I later learnt GUI windows and icon technology from their point of origin, Amiga. With our Amiga 2000, my brother and I basically played pirated games, and played them through the aid of a dongle, that had to be plugged into the back of the Amiga, a point which did pique my curiosity. Our favourite game was Marble Madness. The graphics and visual representation on the Amiga 2000 was just incredible for the time and inspired me greatly. Then, the Internet was not yet available. The digital art application of the Amiga 2000 was powerful and basically, the first non-gaming application I ever used. For the time, it was an incredible piece of coding. The digital art app came with pre-loaded examples of what you could do with the application. The standout, was the Egyptian death-mask of King Tut, which was so real you could touch it. As a young teen, I spend too much money and time at a digital arcade playing Elevator Action, at which I was a gun. To enter the venue, you went through a doorway that was identical to Doctor Who's Tardus. üíûÔ∏è The next computer I had was an Apple Macintosh, I don't remember which model it was in particular, but it was ubiquitous and popular. The monitor was in-buit into the computer and it used rigid re-writable disks unlike the floppy disk of the Amiga. The Macintosh was a number of years after the Amiga, but it didn't hold a torch to it. Amiga was truly brilliant, if you don't know. My first Internet browser was Netscape and my first search engine was Yahoo!, which I was introduced to, the first time I attended university at circa 23 years old. I then registered my first online email account account with Yahoo Australia, which I still use. I am probably one of the very few left with an active Yahoo! Australia email address. My Kung-fu, is not particularly adept, but it is getting stronger, more adept and agile each and every day. Before Bash and Zsh, many years ago I flirted with Pascal on my first GNU/Linux device, which was a very small Acer Netbook, which I then favoured due to its extreme ease of portability. It was always on my person: on my back and in my backpack. My first GNU-Linux distribution was Ubuntu and I have tried circa nine others. I have used a number of iterations of Microsoft operating systems as well of those of Apple. I prefer GNU/Linux, the freedom, the power: the power of community and the absence of greed. In my way, through the power of GNU/Linux, I have taught myself the rudimentary elements of more than a few human languages and hack-translated religious dharmic literature. Many years after flirting with Pascal, I went to university and did a year of Computer Science wherein I was introduced to Java 6. I didn't do very well. It was too steep a learning curve as I had no real networks or support. Most of my younger peers just plagiarised each other's code and had no moral qualms in so doing. Whilst studying Computer Science, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed and came to love, Discrete Mathematics. I had to study and work really hard for the distinction I got, to the detriment of my other subjects. üì´ I am rather excited, as this file will be my first GitHub commit.
