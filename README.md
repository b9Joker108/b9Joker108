- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @b9Joker108
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in Sanskrit, Tibetan, Dharmic Tradfitions, Bash, Zsh, Semiotics, Linguistics, Runes and Heathenism,
- amongst other things.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Bash and Zsh in relation to each other on my Android devices. To productively aid in this,
- I am building an Intranet with Notion, which is my new favorite Android app. In truth, as a learning tool, it is a
- revelation. I am circa 50 years old, and am of the first generation of children that taught themselves computers.
- That is both a boon and a bane. My first computer was a Commodore 64 and my first programming experience was with
- Commodore BASIC, which didn't exactly whet my appetite for Computer Science. I later learnt GUI windows and icon
- technology from their point of origin, Amiga. With our Amiga 2000, my brother and I basically played pirated games,
- and played them through the aid of a dongle that had to be plugged into the back of the Amiga, a point which did pique
- my curiosity. Our favourite game was Marble Madness. The graphics and visual representation on the Amiga 2000 was
- incredible for the time and inspired me greatly. Then, the Internet was not yet available. The digital art application
- of the Amiga 2000 was basically the first non-gaming application I ever used. For the time, it was an incredible piece
- of coding. The digital art app came with pre-loaded examples of what you could do with the application. The standout,
- was the Egyptian death-mask of King Tut, which was so real you could touch it. As a young teen, I spend too much money
- and time at a digital arcade playing Elevator Action, at which I was a gun. To enter the venue, you went through a
- doorway that was identical to Doctor Who's Tardus. üíûÔ∏è The next computer I had was an Apple Mackintosh, I don't remember
- which model it was in particular, but it was ubiquitous and popouar. The monitor was in-buit into the computer and it
- used rigid re-writable disks unl8ke the floppy disk of the Amiga. The Macintosh was a number of years after the Amiga,
- but it didn't hold a torch to it. Amiga was truly brilliant, if you don't know. My Kung-fu, is not particularly adept,
- but it is getting stronger, more adept and agile each and every day. Before Bash and Zsh, many years ago I flirted with
- Pascal on my first GNU/Linux device, which was a very small Acer Netbook, which I then favoured due to its extreme ease
- of portability. It was always on my person: on my back in my backpack. My first GNU-Linux distribution was Ubuntu and I
- have tried circa nine others. I have used a number of iterations of Microsoft operating systems and well as well of those
- of Apple. I prefer GNU/Linux, the freedom, the power: the power of community and absence of greed. In my way, through
- the power of GNU/Linux, I have tasught myself rudimentary elements of few human languages. Many years after flirting with
- Pascal, I went to university and did a year of Computer Science wherein I flirted with Java 6. I didn't do very well. It
- was too steep a learning curve as I had no real networks or support. Most of my younger peers just plagiarized each
- other's code and had no moral qualms in so doing. Whilst doing Computer Science, I was surprised how much I enjoyed and
- loved Discrete Mathematics. I had to study and work really hard for the distinction I got, to the detriment of my other
- subjects. üì´ I am rather excited, as this file will be my first GitHub commit.
